# PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS!

## Description
This project is imitating catering web application with functionalities mentioned below. It's being made for fun, however I try to maintain as clean code as possible and use as much skills as I have while learning some new things. 

## Technologies
* Angular with Material UI and Bootstrap
* HTML/SCSS
* C# with .NET6, Entity Framework and PostgreSql database

## Functionalities
* Register and login system (with auth guard so logged in user cannot login/register) - backend + frontend
* Possibility to change logged in user credentials - backend + frontend
* Daily caloric requirement calculator - frontend
* Ordering catering for some period of time - frontend (+ backend soon)
