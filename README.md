# PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS!
# CateringApp

## Description
This project is planned to imitate catering web application with functionalities like user account (register, login, change credentials etc.), admin account, ordering catering for some period of time, calculating caloric requirement, sending e-mail to confirm catering order. There will be also unit tests included. I'm making it mainly for fun, however I try to maintain as clean code as possible and use as much skills as I have while learning some new things. 

## Technologies
* Angular with Material UI and Bootstrap
* HTML/SCSS
* C# with .NET6, Entity Framework and PostgreSql database
